# ClubsManagementSystemWebsite
This is a project for the "Freshman Project" course. A Console Application was created using HTML, CSS, (bootstrap), PHP, and connected to a MySQL database.
The website is supposed to represent a clubs management system for a university.
It tracks all the Clubs, the Users, the President fo each club, and the members of each club.
Each user can see the list of clubs, join clubs, or leave club.
When a user creates a club, they become the club president.
A club president can remove members of their club, but cannot create any other club.
A system super admin has all privileges, and they can modify anything they want in the system.
